We had a great time at the [South Side Science Festival][1]!

Dozens of families from the South Side of Chicago came by to experience our demonstrations of phase separation (vortexing was a huge hit with kids), color in diagrams of yeast cells, gaze in wonder at our 3D-printed cell models, and hang out with our team as we dropped some knowledge (and, okay, also some candy...). Can't wait to do it again next year!
