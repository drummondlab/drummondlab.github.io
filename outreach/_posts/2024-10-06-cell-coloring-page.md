We made a coloring page to help you learn yeast cell biology!

We encourage you to be free with your colors. You many notice some places where the seemingly different shapes/spaces seem to be continuous...that's biology! So much of cell biology is discovery and an attempt by us humans to understand something too tiny to see with our naked eyes, so ancient and unfamiliar that we've had to give things names without knowing quite what they do, and so complex that we don't have it all figured out yet. Hope you enjoy seeing just a taste of what researchers have been able to identify.
