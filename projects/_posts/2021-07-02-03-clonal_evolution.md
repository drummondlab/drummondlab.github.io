Cancer samples are heterogeneous, containing a mixture of normal cells and cancer cells that often represents multiple subclones. We developed and continue to develop tools (ABSOLUTE, Phylogic, PhylogicNDT) for characterizing the heterogeneity of cancer samples using copy-number and mutation data measured on bulk samples and now also using single cells. Using these tools, we can infer which mutations are clonal or sub-clonal, as well as estimate the number of subclones and their distribution over space and time. This enables us to study resistance to therapy and introduce these concepts into clinical trials.
