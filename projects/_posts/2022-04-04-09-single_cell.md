Our efforts to understand cancer biology at the single-cell level have made major advances in the last few years. For example, in close collaboration with Dr. Irene Ghobrialâ€™s lab, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor cells in bone marrow biopsies from Multiple Myeloma patients to map out how the composition and expression of each immune population change during disease progression, from the earliest asymptomatic stages to overt MM. Specifically, our analysis revealed loss of memory cytotoxic T cells and major histocompatibility complex class II dysregulation in CD14+ monocytes ([Zavidij, Haradhvala, Mouhieddine, et al., Nature Cancer 2020]).
