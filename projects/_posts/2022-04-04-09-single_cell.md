Our efforts to understand cancer biology at the single-cell level have made major advances in the last few years. For example, in close collaboration with Dr. Irene Ghobrialâ€™s lab, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor cells in bone marrow biopsies from Multiple Myeloma patients to map out how the composition and expression of each immune population change during disease progression, from the earliest asymptomatic stages to overt MM. Specifically, our analysis revealed loss of memory cytotoxic T cells and major histocompatibility complex class II dysregulation in CD14+ monocytes ([Zavidij, Haradhvala, Mouhieddine, et al., Nature Cancer 2020]). Additional studies in the lab are using single-cell data to focus on studying MM tumor cells and their relationship to the microenvironment ([Boiarsky, et al., medRxiv preprint 2022]), as well as understanding the response and resistance to CAR-T therapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) ([Haradhvala, Leick, Maurer, Gohil, et al., medRxiv preprint 2022]).
