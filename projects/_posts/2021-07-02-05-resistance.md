We have an [ongoing collaboration with IBM Watson Health](https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/ibm-watson-health-and-broad-institute-launch-major-research-initiative-study-why-cancers-become) to study why cancers become drug resistant, a study that is fostering many new clinical collaborations with investigators across the US, each bringing their own cohort of patients with a specific cancer type.

To help understand how cancers become resistant to specific therapies, Broad Institute will generate tumor genome sequence data from patients who initially respond to treatment but who then become drug-resistant. Broad will use new genome-editing methods to conduct large-scale cancer drug resistance studies in the laboratory, to help identify tumors’ specific vulnerabilities. IBM scientists will use Watson to analyze this data and identify genomic patterns that may help researchers and clinicians predict drug sensitivity and resistance.

This new partnership is expected to help lay a new foundation for understanding the basis of drug resistance in cancer – especially the genetic mechanisms observed in patients – and accelerate research across the cancer community to turn knowledge of resistance mechanisms into therapies
