Over the past decades, many post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and acetylation, have been studied for their role in regulating cell signaling events that are key for all cellular physiological functions. Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS) technologies have enabled measurement of these modifications and examination of their prevalence in cancer. Most studies thus far have focused on a single type of modification in a specific tumor type. We seek to understand the joint underlying patterns of PTMs in molecular signaling pathways that are shared across multiple cancer types by studying changes in protein acetylation and phosphorylation. We are involved in the NCIâ€™s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium ([CPTAC]) efforts in collaboration with Drs. D.R. Mani, Stephen Carr, Lewis Cantley, and Li Ding, among others.

We previously developed innovative computational methods called CLUMPS (clustering of mutations in protein structures) that measures spatial clustering of mutations on the protein surfaces, thus translating mutations into corresponding amino acid changes and clusters on protein structures ([Kamburov et al., PNAS 2015]). The key advantage of CLUMPS is that it employs a more accurate background model and uses homology modeling to map proteins to 3D structures. We are now applying this approach to PTM sites.
