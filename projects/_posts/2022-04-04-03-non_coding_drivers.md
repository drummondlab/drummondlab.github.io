We helped lead TCGA into its next phase with the Pan-cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) effort of TCGA and ICGC, contributing to 4 of the 23 papers released across the Nature journals in February 2020, including the flagship paper ([The ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Consortium, Nature 2020]). In one of our studies, we searched for drivers in the non-coding regions (~99% of the genome) in whole genomes from cancer patients by employing our statistically rigorous strategies to analyze both point mutations and structural variants ([Rheinbay, Nielsen, Abascal, Wala, Shapira, et al. Nature 2020]). Although we discovered a few novel non-coding driver genes (e.g., point mutations in the 5â€² region of TP53), our study revealed that cancer drivers in non-coding regions are relatively rare, with the vast majority of drivers (87%) occurring in just the ~1% of the genome that is protein-coding.
