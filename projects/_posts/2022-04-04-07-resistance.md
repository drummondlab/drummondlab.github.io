We have an ongoing collaboration with IBM Research to study why cancers become drug resistant, a study that is fostering many new clinical collaborations with investigators across the US (currently over 20), each bringing their own cohort of patients with a specific cancer type.

This collaboration is focused on better understanding how cancers become resistant to specific therapies. We, along with our collaborators at the Broad (Genomics Platform, [Dependency Map]), are generating tumor genome sequence data from patients that initially respond to treatment but then become drug-resistant. We are employing new genome-editing methods to conduct large-scale cancer drug resistance studies in the laboratory to help identify tumors’ specific vulnerabilities. IBM scientists will use IBM Watson®, their Artificial Intelligence–capable computing system, to analyze this data and identify genomic patterns that may help researchers and clinicians predict drug sensitivity and resistance.

This new partnership is expected to help lay a new foundation for understanding the basis of drug resistance in cancer – especially the genetic mechanisms observed in patients – and accelerate research across the cancer community to turn knowledge of resistance mechanisms into therapies.

As one example highlighting this work, the first study we published in this partnership with Dr. Ryan Corcoran’s team at MGH ([Parikh, Leshchiner, Elagina, et al. Nat Med 2019]) used our PhylogicNDT suite of tools to compare liquid biopsies to standard tumor biopsies in gastrointestinal cancer patients developing drug resistance and found that liquid biopsies harbored genetic alterations associated with drug resistance that were not identified through standard tissue biopsies in 80% of cases. Moreover, our analysis revealed that patients developed not just one, but many resistance mechanisms. Beyond this published study, the broader IBM–Broad collaboration currently has over 30 other ongoing sub-projects at various stages and across many specific cancer types, many of which are revealing valuable and potentially clinically actionable insights into resistance mechanisms.
