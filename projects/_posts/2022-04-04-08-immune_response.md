We have developed a tool, POLYSOLVER ([Shukla et al., Nature Biotechnology 2015]), for genotyping HLA alleles and identifying somatic mutations in tumors. We used mutation data and HLA haplotypes to infer neoantigens across cancer, and predicted neoantigens were used as part of a vaccination trial in melanoma. We also developed tools for analysis of mutations in single-cell data and are applying this technology to both tumors and immune cells, including in Multiple Myeloma ([Zavidij, Haradhvala, Mouhieddine, et al. Nature Cancer 2020]).
