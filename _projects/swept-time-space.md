summary: >
  Typical approaches to using supercomputing systems to solve large systems of
  partial differential equations, like those governing fluid flow, require
  significant amounts of memory transfer at every computational time step. This
  project is developing a method to reduce the number of communication steps
  compared with typical approaches, with the goal of improving overall performance.
