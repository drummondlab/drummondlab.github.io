summary: >
  Simulations of reacting fluid flows can be performed with accurate models for
  chemical kinetics by intelligently choosing and designing appropriate solvers.
  For this project, we are looking at choosing the best algorithm based on local
  conditions in a simulation and also the available computing hardware.
