summary: >
  The combustion community has generated many thousands of fundamental combustion
  data points using a variety of experimental apparatuses, which are extremely useful
  for validating and refining models for fuel oxidation. However, most such data
  are either represented via figures or tables, not openly accessible, or stored
  in a format not easily readable by people or machines. This project is designing
  human and machine-readable data standards for combustion measurements, and
  building an open, community database for them (along with tools to use the data).
