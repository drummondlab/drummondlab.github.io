Chidimma Nzerem joined the Getz lab in the spring of 2020. She received her B.A. in biology from Columbia University and her M.S. in biostatistics from Harvard School of Public Health.  She is currently analyzing whole-exome sequencing data to more accurately identify clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) in multiple myeloma patients. She plans to study computational biology further in graduate school. 

In her free time she enjoys hiking, cooking, baking, organic gardening, and learning about soil biodiversity.
