Thomas joined the Getz lab as a Research Associate in June of 2019. Currently, he is using experimental and computational approaches to understand the mechanisms by which chromatin modifiers mediate therapy resistance in ER+ Breast Cancer. Prior to joining the lab, Thomas received a BS in Biological Sciences from the University of Pittsburgh where he worked on mechanisms of cell abscission delay in the William Saunders lab. 

Outside of the lab, he enjoys playing sports (fencing, sailing, rock climbing) and trying out new cooking and baking recipes.
