Samantha joined the Getz Lab in May 2022 as a summer intern. She is currently working on creating an interactive dashboard to integrate mutation information, phylogenetic data, copy number profiles, etc. on a patient-by-patient basis for review and annotation.
She is currently a senior at Penn State University where she studies Computer Science with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. In the future, she plans to pursue a career combining the two, using a computational approach to solve biological problems.
Outside of the lab, she enjoys spending time on Lake Winnipesaukee with her family, doing yoga, and reading.
