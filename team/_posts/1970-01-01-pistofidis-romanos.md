Romanos is a physician-scientist who specializes in experimental and computational immunooncology research in plasma cell malignancies. He received his MD with honors from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, and completed his postdoctoral training at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Harvard Medical School (HMS) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. He is currently an Instructor in Medicine in the Department of Medical Oncology at DFCI, HMS and the Broad. He also serves as a Fellow for the Broad Institute’s Research Communication Lab and an Ambassador for the American Society of Hematology.
His research focus is to determine genetic and immunological causes of disease progression from premalignant states, such as Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) and Smoldering Multiple Myeloma or Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, to full-blown malignancy, with the goal of developing novel clinical-grade assays to improve risk stratification and patient outcome. His research has been recognized with Young Investigator Awards from the International Myeloma Workshop, the International Workshop for Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia and the Hellenic Society of Hematology, and is supported by the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation’s Research Fellowship Award, the International Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia Foundation’s Robert A. Kyle Award, and the Claudia Adams Barr Award for Innovative Basic Cancer Research.
