I started as an ACB in June 2020 after graduating from Tufts University. I majored
in applied physics, with a senior thesis in computational particle physics as a research member
of the [MicroBooNE collaboration at Fermi National Laboratory](https://microboone.fnal.gov/).
I joined the Broad Institute with the hope of applying the advances in machine learning
and computation I was exposed to as an undergraduate to human healthcare.

I am currently involved in two joint projects:
- A collaboration between the [Gray Foundation](https://www.grayfoundation.org/) and the [Ellisen Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital](http://ellisenlab.com/).
- The [IBM Watson Health Cancer Drug Resistance](https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/ibm-watson-health-and-broad-institute-launch-major-research-initiative-study-why-cancers-become) research initiative.


I enjoy the challenge of creating automated solutions to previously intractable problems.
