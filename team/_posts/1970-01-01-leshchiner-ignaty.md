Ignaty Leshchiner is an Associate Director of the Computational Biology team in the Cancer Genome Analysis group, a component of the Cancer Program of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. He works on computational analysis of cancer genome data and specifically on tumor heterogeneity, progression, timing of early events in cancer and treatment evasion. He is interested in applying new genomic technologies such as blood biopsy, long-range read phasing, and single cell sequencing for analysis and understanding of biology behind tumor development, treatment evasion, and progression to metastasis.

Leshchiner’s background is in developing statistical methods for analysis of genomics data and application of these methods to understanding biology and finding treatment for various disease conditions. He currently is an active member of the International Cancer Genome Consortium project to analyze whole genomes (Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes), where he is performing heterogeneity analysis across cancer. He was also active on the TCGA Analysis working groups performing a full scope of genomics analysis and is currently actively developing and applying tools for multi-sample and longitudinal biopsies analysis, including deep study of mutational landscape, clonal/subclonal evolution, chromothripsis, genome doubling, and evasion from existing and novel therapies.

Prior to joining the Broad Institute in 2013, Leshchiner worked for Partners Healthcare as a bioinformatician in the genetics division of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, where he contributed to the CLARITY Challenge-winning team in 2012. He has previous consulting experience for Hybrid Silica Technologies and prior research fellowships at UMass Lowell and Moscow State University.

Leshchiner obtained a Ph.D. in chemistry from Moscow State University, which included a visiting scientist appointment in the Langer Lab at MIT. He completed postdoctoral training in bioinformatics and computational biology at Harvard Medical School.
