Following this training, he completed internal medicine residency within the Stanbury Physician Scientist Program at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) followed by training in
Gastroenterology at the MGH where his research focused on immune checkpoint related adverse events. Yousef then returned to serve as a Chief Medical Resident in the Internal
