Chris is a graduate student in the Chemical Biology PhD program at Harvard Medical School, which he joined in Fall 2021. He is advised by Professor Gaddy Getz, PhD at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. His main research interest is to understand the molecular mechanisms driving somatic evolution in healthy and pathological conditions, with a particular focus on their clinical implications.

Towards this goal, Chris uses a mixture of theoretical, biological, and quantitative approaches to analyze experimental and clinical data. His work involves building novel computational tools and mathematical modeling to map the genomic landscape of somatic evolution, especially in primary and metastatic human cancers.

Prior to starting his doctoral studies at Harvard University, Chris worked for two biopharmaceutical companies conducting functional genomics and immuno-oncology research to help identify novel cancer targets and biomarkers and guide the development of next generation cancer immunotherapy drugs.

Chris earned a M.Sc. in Bioinformatics from Johns Hopkins University in 2018. He also graduated with two B.Sc.s in Chemistry and Molecular, Cell & Developmental Biology from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2015.

In his free time, Chris enjoys reading, cycling, and dancing.
