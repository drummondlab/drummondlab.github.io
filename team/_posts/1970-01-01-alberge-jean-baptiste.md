Jean-Baptiste is a postdoctoral fellow in the Getz lab and in the [Ghobrial lab](https://ghobriallab.dana-farber.org/)
(Dana Farber Cancer Institute). 
Prior to joining the Boston / Cambridge area, he received a Dipl. Ing. 
in Computational science for healthcare and life science from Centrale Nantes, and a PhD from Universit√© de Nantes 
in France.

His research focuses on a particular cancer, multiple myeloma. 
This hematological malignancy develops from a clinically well-defined continuum 
of indolent stages, but the clonal architecture and prediction power of most genomic alterations discovered
at these stages remains to be investigated.

When he is not analyzing genomic data, Jean-Baptiste enjoys learning the piano, running along the Charles river,
and maybe drinking a glass of French wine with his friends?
