I joined the lab as an associate computational biologist in July of 2021 after graduating with an Sc.B. in Computational Biology (with a focus in applied math/statistics) and A.B. in Engineering from Brown University. After dabbling in various wet lab/bioengineering research throughout undergrad, the summer before my senior year I started conducting computational biology research under Prof. Ritambhara Singh and wrote my honors thesis on using deep learning (specifically graph convolutional neural networks) to integrate Hi-C data to model long-range epigenetic regulatory interactions. Since I’ve joined the Getz Lab I’ve focused on genomic analysis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as well as quality assurance of our whole-genome mutation-calling pipelines, and I currently seek to develop more robust and practical methods for structural variant detection.
