Xavi joined the lab as an associate computational biologist in July of 2021 after graduating with an Sc.B. in Computational Biology (with a focus in applied math/statistics) and A.B. in Engineering from Brown University. After dabbling in various wet lab/bioengineering research throughout undergrad, the summer before his senior year he started conducting computational biology research under Prof. Ritambhara Singh and wrote his honors thesis on using deep learning (specifically graph convolutional neural networks) to integrate Hi-C data to model long-range epigenetic regulatory interactions. Since Xavi has joined the Getz Lab he has focused on genomic analysis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as well as quality assurance of the lab's whole-genome mutation-calling pipelines, and he currently seeks to develop more robust and practical methods for structural variant detection. Outside of research, Xavi likes reading, basketball and baseball statistics, animated TV shows, powerlifting, and occasionally pushing fashion norms with his pants.
