Tim graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from University of Maryland: College Park - specializing in algorithms, machine learning, and computational biology. Within the Getz lab, his current project focuses on classification methods for Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and meaningful metric development to facilitate model interpretation. Tim seeks to continue his career in computational medicine through a PhD (applying to programs for Fall 2023 admission), where he hopes to continue methods development to interrogate difficult to quantify cancer types.
