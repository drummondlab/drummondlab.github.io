Rebecca is a 3rd year PhD student in EECS at MIT, co-advised by Gad Getz at the Broad Institute and David Sontag in MIT CSAIL.

Before starting her PhD, Rebecca worked on the Molecular Profiling team at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which sparked her fascination with algorithms for genomic data. She received a Bachelor’s degree in Physics from Stern College of Yeshiva University, and a Master’s in Biomedical Engineering from Columbia University.

Rebecca’s research focuses on developing machine learning algorithms that utilize clinical and genomic data to better understand health and disease, with a particular focus on genomics and cancer. She is most excited about research with clinical or translational impact and the ultimate the goal of improving human health outcomes.
