I joined Getz Lab as an Associate Computational Biologist in early 2020, right before the pandemic started. My research here focuses on using single cell RNA-seq analysis to help understand the changes in the immune system of precursor conditions of Multiple Myeloma.

I received a B.S. in Pharmaceutical Science from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, and M.S.s in Pharmacology and Bioinformatics from Northeastern University here in Boston.

Outside of work I enjoy knitting, baking, playing guitar and hiking in warmer weather.
