Ariel is a Research Assistant at the NBC lab. Ariel completed her B.S. at Cornell University, and realized her passion for cognitive neuroscience research during her time as a doctoral student in Counseling Psychology at the University of Miami. She has worked with several research labs in the Departments of Psychology and Counseling Psychology, and her research interests include, broadly, the neuroscience of cognition-emotion interactions in clinical and non-clinical populations. More specifically, Ariel is interested in how functional and dysfunctional reward processing impacts cognitive performance. In the future, she plans to pursue a Ph.D. in either clinical or research psychology.
