After graduating from MIT in June 2018 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Molecular Biology, Liz joined the group to complete her Master's of Engineering degree from MIT in the same field. On completion of her Master's in 2020, she continued her work with the group as an Associate Computational Biologist. She is working on projects related to tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance in cancer in the context of rapid autopsies in collaboration with IBM and MGH. She uses computational methods to examine and understand the spread of cancer throughout the body and patients' resistance to therapies. Outside of the lab, Liz is a 2022 US National Team rower, recently qualifying for the 2022 World Rowing Championships in the Lightweight Women's Quad and winning the Head of the Charles regatta in the lightweight women's single in 2021.
