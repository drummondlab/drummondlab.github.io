Alyssa joined the Getz lab in the summer of 2022 after graduating Purdue University with B.S. in Microbiology. Her current efforts at the Broad include understanding the mechanisms and impact of specific driver mutations in melanoma. Alyssaâ€™s previous work at Purdue in the Mattoo Lab involved high-throughput fluorescent drug screens for mediators of the Fic protein HYPE. 

Outside of the lab, Alyssa enjoys cooking and baking, reading, cross-stitch, and video games.
