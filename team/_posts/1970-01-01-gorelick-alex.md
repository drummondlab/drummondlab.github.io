Alex is a postdoctoral fellow in the Getz Lab and the laboratory of Dr. Kamila Naxerova (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School). His research focuses on applying phylogenetic and statistical analyses to cancer genomes to understand the molecular underpinnings of cancer evolution and metastasis. 

He received his PhD in computational biology and medicine at Cornell University/Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the lab of Dr. Barry Taylor, where he studied cancer genomics. Alex is an avid R user and a big fan of vim, and uses an overly convoluted setup to connect the two. 

Outside of lab, he is usually biking around the city, playing with his 3D printer, or relaxing at home with his wife and cat.
