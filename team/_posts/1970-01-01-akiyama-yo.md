I joined the lab as an Associate Computational Biologist in the summer
of 2020 after graduating from Williams College with a B.A. in Computer
Science. I am working on developing computational methods and
applying them to large proteogenomic and single-cell transcriptomic
datasets to uncover mechanisms of the DNA damage response and its
deficiencies in cancer. I also investigate the regulation of the human
proteome and its relationship to genetic variation.

Outside of the lab, I compete out of Purple Valley Wrestling Club in
the USA freeestyle wrestling circuit.
