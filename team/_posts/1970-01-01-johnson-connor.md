Connor joined the lab in June 2021 as an Associate Computational Biologist. He currently works on researching advanced and refractory cancers, as well as mechanisms of acquired tumor resistance.

He received his B.S. in Computational Biology from Brown University, where he also researched neural ensemble decoding and brain-computer interfaces. He plans to continue his studies of computational biology in graduate school. 

Outside of work, Connor enjoys playing guitar, hunting for old records, and climbing.
