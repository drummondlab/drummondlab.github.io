Before joining the Getz lab, Binyamin received a PhD in Computational Biology from Bar-Ilan University, Israel. His graduate studies focused on mechanisms that enhance diversity and accelerate genomic change in evolution and cancer. Specifically, retrotransposon activity dynamics, APOBEC hypermutation and their synergistic impact on genomic diversity. He also took part in pan-cancer RNA-seq analyses of RNA-editing and retrotransposon activity.

In the Getz lab, Binyamin worked on the "CLL-map" project, where he led an international team that assembled and analyzed multiomic data from >1100 patients to define the molecular landscape of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and identify determinants of patient outcome. His current projects focus on CLL drug sensitivity, proteogenomics and immunogenomics to facilitate precision medicine for this common leukemia. This work is conducted in collaboration with Dr. Catherine J. Wu and is partially funded by an EMBO postdoctoral fellowship.
