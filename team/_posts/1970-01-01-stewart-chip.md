Chip is an Associate Director at the [Broad Institute] in the Getz Lab.  He joined the Getz Lab in 2011 as a Computational Biologist. 

Prior to joining the Broad, Chip was a Research Professor at [Boston College] focusing on Structural Variant and Mobile Element Insertion discovery from Next Generation Sequencing whole genome data, in particular with the [1000 Genomes] consortium under the guidance of Gabor Marth.  
He received his Ph.D. in Particle Physics [Indiana University] in 1988 under the guidance of Andrzej Zieminski, spending many years as a graduate student and then as post-doc at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Shortly following the discovery of the top quark in 1995, Chip worked under the direction of Ivan Pal at Biologic Systems Corp developing neurodiagnostic software tools.
