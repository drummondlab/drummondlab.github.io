Benny completed his PhD in biology at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology under the supervision of Prof. Yeduda G. Assaraf. During his graduate studies he focused on understanding the role of lysosomes in cancer resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and demonstrating that lysosomal accumulation of certain widely used drugs triggers lysosomal exocytosis and activation of lysosomal biogenesis, both of which contribute to drug resistance by reducing drug concentration at the cellular target site.    

Following this training, Benny joined the Getz lab as a Postdoctoral Scholar. His research is currently focused on developing new technologies for high-resolution lineage tracing of cancer cells, and utilizing said technologies to study the evolution and underlying molecular mechanisms of cancer drug persistence.
