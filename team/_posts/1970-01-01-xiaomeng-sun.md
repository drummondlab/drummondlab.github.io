After Xiaomeng finished her Ph.D. in Biomedical Science at Fudan University (Shanghai, China) in 2019, she joined a genetic testing company that provides precision medicine services for cancer patients to investigate how scientific outcomes can be used to accelerate cancer care in the industry.

She joined the Getz Family in September 2022, with a strong research interest in the interaction between cancer and the human immune system. She embarks on a new adventure in the cancer microenvironment projects involving CAR-T therapy in multiple myeloma.

Xiaomeng enjoys running in her spare time. She is also very fond of sitting in a sunny room reading, writing, or painting.
