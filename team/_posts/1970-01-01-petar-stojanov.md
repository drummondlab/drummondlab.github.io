Petar is a postdoctoral researcher at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where he is supervised by Prof. Gad Getz. He received his PhD in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where he was fortunate to be advised by Jaime Carbonell and Kun Zhang. Prior to that, he was an associate computational biologist at the Getz Lab.

His research interests span machine learning and computational biology. He is currently very interested in applying causal discovery methodology to improve genomic analysis of cancer mutation and single-cell RNA sequencing data with the goal of understanding relevant causal relationships in cancer progression. His doctoral research was in transfer learning and domain adaptation from the causal perspective, a field which he is still interested and active.
