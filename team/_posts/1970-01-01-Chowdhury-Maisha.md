Maisha joined the experimental team within the Getz Lab early 2022 as a Research Associate. Her efforts are in studying the way cancer resistance evolve, as well as developing a high-throughput platform for profiling them.

She holds a B.S. in Chemistry and plans to pursue graduate school in Cancer Biology. When Maisha is not conducting wet lab experiments, she enjoys going to indie music concerts and reading books.
