Junko joined the Getz Lab as a computational scientist in 2022. Her main focus in the lab is single cell data analyses on cancers.  Prior to joining the lab she worked as a computational scientist in the Genomics Platform at [the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) (2017-2022), developing and benchmarking analysis pipelines to ensure quality control of cancer related sequencing data.  

As for her educational background, she completed my postdoctoral training at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. She obtained a Ph.D. and a M.S. in computational biology from the University of Tokyo, and received a B.S. in engineering from Soka University (Japan).

Outside of work, she loves traveling to explore new places and finding nice brewries, distilleries, and wineries on the way.
