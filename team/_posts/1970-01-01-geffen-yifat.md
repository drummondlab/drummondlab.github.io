I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the lab of Prof. Gad Getz at the Broad Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. My research focuses on understanding the dynamic role of Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) in tumor progression, as well as their cross-talk and how they contribute to the dysregulation of signaling pathways across cancer. My work involves addressing those research aims both through computational analyses and in wet-lab experiments. I am a member of the National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), which is a national effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of large-scale proteogenomics. I obtained my PhD in Biochemistry from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel under the supervision of Prof. Tommer Ravid. During my PhD (in collaboration with Prof. Nir Friedman), we established an integrated proteogenomic approach for identifying degradation motifs in eukaryotic cells. I graduated with an MSc in Human Genetics from the same institute.
