Prior to starting at the Broad, Mike worked at MIT with their varsity sailing program where he spent much of the last few years traveling across New England. Outside of work, he likes to spend his time cooking and getting outdoors as much as possible. Mike loves hiking, hanging out at the beach, and competitively sailing.
