Juan Carlos graduated from Harvard with an A.B. in Mathematics. He then completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge University, where he studied geometry and statistical inference. In the Getz Lab, he is working on a blood biopsy assay to precisely monitor disease in patients with lymphoma. He is also interested in developing new methods for single-cell RNA-sequencing data. 
In his free time, Juan Carlos enjoys keeping up with math, especially harmonic analysis and differential geometry.
