Brian is the Scientific Operations Manager for Gad Getzâ€™s Cancer Genome Computational Analysis Group. He also serves as the Lead Project and Alliance Manager for the Broad/IBM Cancer Resistance Project. Brian received his PhD in Molecular Biology from the University of Delaware (Newark, DE) and has held postdoctoral fellowships at Rice University (Houston, TX) and MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). Over his scientific career, his areas of scientific research and experience/expertise include ocular lens and extracellular matrix biology, cancer biology, targeted nanoparticle delivery and cellular ablation, and genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of acquired drug resistance.

Prior to coming to the Broad, he was an Instructor at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Department of Endocrine Neoplasia and Hormonal Disorders), where he collaborated extensively with clinicians and other scientists in conducting translational cancer research on advanced papillary thyroid cancer. Before returning to school for his PhD, he was a system engineer where he built and maintained UNIX servers and fiber optic storage area networks. Throughout his career stages, he has been interested in finding novel ways to improve and simplify methods and processes, which helps him in my current role leading the operations for projects aimed at understanding how cancers become resistant to therapies in a wide breadth of cancer and treatment types. Much of what he does involves developing and maintaining collaborator relationships, developing project scopes and goals, and facilitating data analysis and publication phases of each project.
