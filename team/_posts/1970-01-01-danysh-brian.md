I am the Scientific Operations Manager for the Cancer Resistance Project within Gad Getz’s Cancer Genome Computational Analysis Group. I received my PhD in Molecular Biology from the University of Delaware (Newark, DE) and held postdoctoral fellowships at Rice University (Houston, TX) and MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). My areas of scientific research and experience/expertise over my scientific career include ocular lens and extracellular matrix biology, cancer biology, targeted nanoparticle delivery and cellular ablation, and genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of acquired drug resistance. Prior to the Broad, I was an Instructor at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Department of Endocrine Neoplasia and Hormonal Disorders), where I collaborated extensively with clinicians and other scientists in conducting translational cancer research on advanced papillary thyroid cancer. Prior to returning to school for my PhD, I was a system engineer where I built and maintained UNIX servers and fiber optic storage area networks. Throughout my career stages I’ve been interested in finding novel ways to improve and simplify methods and processes, which has helped me in my current role where I lead operations for projects aimed at understanding how cancers become resistant to therapies in a wide breadth of cancer and treatment types. Much of what I do involves developing and maintaining collaborator relationships, developing project scopes and goals, and facilitating data analysis and publication phases of each project.
