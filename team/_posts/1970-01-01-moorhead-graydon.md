Graydon graduated from Harvard College, majoring in Applied Mathematics with a focus in the Biological Sciences and a minor in Germanic Studies. He wrote his undergraduate thesis in the Michor Lab at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, creating a spatial model of lung cancer that focussed on radiationâ€™s effects on cellular motility. He joined the Getz lab in October of 2022 as an associate computational biologist, and is currently working on a project to uncover mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy treatment in head and neck cancer.

In his free time, Graydon is an avid runner and trumpet player. You can often find him trying to increase his yearly spotify minutes or sprinting down the Charles for no good reason.
