Claudia joined the Getz Lab early 2021 as an Associate Computational Biologist. She currently works on genomic analysis of leukemias (MDS/AML, CLL) and tool development for automating manual review. 

She recieved a B.S. in Computer Science and a Minor in Biology at Georgia Tech. In the future she plans to pursue graduate school to continue her studies in computational applications in biological research. 

Outside of research, she enjoys volleyball, longboarding, and running 🏃. When she can't be outside, she also likes baking 🍰, knitting, and piano 🎹.
