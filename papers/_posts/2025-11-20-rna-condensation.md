# Abstract 

Stress-induced mRNP condensation is conserved across eukaryotes, resulting in
stress granule formation under intense stresses, yet the mRNA composition and
function of these condensates remain unclear. Exposure of ribosome-free mRNA
following stress is thought to cause condensation and stress granule formation through
mRNA-sequence-dependent interactions, leading to disproportionate condensation of
long mRNAs. Here we show that, in contrast, virtually all mRNAs condense in
response to multiple stresses in budding yeast with minor length dependence and
often without stress granule formation. New transcripts escape mRNP condensation,
enabling their selective translation. Inhibiting translation initiation causes formation of
mRNP condensates distinct from stress granules and P-bodies; these translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are omnipresent, even in unstressed cells. Stress-induced mRNAs are excluded from TIICs due to the timing of their expression,
indicating determinants of escape that are independent of sequence. Together, our
results reveal a previously undetected level of translation-linked molecular organization
and stress-responsive regulation.
