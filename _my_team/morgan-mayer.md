Morgan received her MS in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science, and her thesis research involved using machine learning methods to predict fuel properties from infrared spectroscopy.

She graduated with her Honors BS in Chemical Engineering from Oregon State University; as an undergraduate research assistant she worked on collecting and standardizing experimental combustion data for validating and improving chemical kinetic models.
