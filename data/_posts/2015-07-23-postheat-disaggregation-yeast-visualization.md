Interactive data visualization for disaggregation and new-synthesis data from [our 2015 paper on heat-triggered protein aggregation in yeast][1], Figure 6. (Aggregation data visualization is [here][2].)
	
Choose detected proteins by official yeast name, from [SGD](http://www.yeastgenome.org/).

Cells were grown at 30&deg;C, shifted to labeled media, heat-shocked for 10 minutes at 42&deg;C, moved back to 30&deg;C for recovery, and protein in 100,000g supernatant measured. Y-axis is ratio of protein in supernatant between treated and control cells, X-axis is either time or temperature of shock. Linetype reflects isotopic label on the amino acids: solid line is arginine/lysine imported before onset of heat shock, dashed line is imported after shock.
