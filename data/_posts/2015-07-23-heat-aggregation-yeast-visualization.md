Interactive data visualization for data from [our 2015 paper on heat-triggered protein aggregation in yeast][1], Figure 1. (Disaggregation data visualization is [here][2].)

Choose detected proteins by official yeast name, from [SGD](http://www.yeastgenome.org/).

Y-axis is proportion of protein in 100,000g supernatant, X-axis is either time or temperature of shock.
