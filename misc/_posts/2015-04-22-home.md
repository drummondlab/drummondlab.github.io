The Neuroinformatics and Brain Connectivity (NBC) Laboratory focuses on characterizing activation within and between brain regions among healthy individuals and those diagnosed with neuropsychiatric disorders. With emphasis on development of data analysis algorithms, neuroscience informatics tools, and neuroimaging ontologies, the Lab’s mission is to enhance understanding of (dys)functional brain networks in health and disease. Improved understanding of such brain networks may impact educational trajectories for students (e.g., [Exploring the Neural Mechanisms of Physics Learning](/projects/physics-learning)), as well as treatment outcomes for patients (e.g., [Impact of HIV and Cannabis on Brain Function](/projects/hiv-cannabis)). Through our various projects, the Lab aims to address real-world issues. If you would like to know more about specific projects, you are welcome to visit us on [GitHub](https://github.com/NBCLab) and the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/m4x75/).
