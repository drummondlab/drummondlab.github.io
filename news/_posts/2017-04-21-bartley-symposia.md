---

Jessica Bartley, a Ph.D. candidate in the Neuroinformatics and Brain Connectivity lab, has won 2nd place in the Florida Statewide Graduate Student Research Symposium (Education Division) for her work on the neural correlates of physics learning! Her featured poster, Understanding the Neural Substrates of Physics Problem Solving: Brain Mechanisms and Behavior Correlates, presented findings from her fMRI investigation on the neural basis of physics classroom learning and problem solving skill development.

This honor follows a 1st place award (Education Division) for Jessica’s presentation at Florida International University’s annual Graduate Student Scholarly Forum, a University-wide celebration of 100+ graduate student research projects. Jessica’s outstanding Scholarly Forum performance afforded her, as one of only 11 FIU graduate students, the opportunity to represent FIU at the statewide competition. Awards at this Florida Statewide Graduate Student Research Symposium are in recognition of research excellence for top graduate research projects across the state of Florida. Jessica was one of three FIU students to receive awards at this event.

Congratulations to the winners!
