Jessica Bartley, a graduate researcher in the Neuroinformatics and Brain Connectivity lab, has been awarded top prize for her data blitz presentation at this year’s regional BrainHack Americas Conference. Twelve neuroimaging trainees competed at the University of Miami in a series of talks highlighting work from multiple ongoing projects. Jessica’s talk, titled “Exploring the Neural Mechanisms of Physics Learning”, featured preliminary analyses from her ongoing fMRI study to understand neural correlates of physics learning and physics problem solving. She shared 1st place and a $600 award with two other neuroimaging trainees, Iris Broce (Florida International University) and Jason Nomi (University of Miami). Congratulations to the winners!
