Exciting news! A team of 14 FIU scientists has been awarded $12.7 million from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA/NIH) to study the impact of substance use on adolescent brain development. NIDAâ€™s nationwide, multisite project termed the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study will follow approximately 10,000 children beginning at ages 9 to 10, before they initiate drug use, through the period of highest risk for substance use and other mental health disorders. Scientists will track exposure to substances (e.g., nicotine, marijuana, alcohol), academic achievement, cognitive skills, mental health, and brain structure and function. Drs. Laird, Sutherland, and Dick represent the neuroimaging core of ABCD-FIU, of which Dr. Gonzalez is the Principal Investigator.
