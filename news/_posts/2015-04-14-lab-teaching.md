excerpt: Lab researchers celebrate Brain Awareness Week at the Miami Museum of Science.
---

This week, researchers from the Neuroinformatics and Brain Connectivity Laboratory (NBC) took part in Miami’s “Brain Awareness Week,” organized by the Patricia and Phillip Frost Miami Museum of Science. At the Museum’s “Science Up Close” and “Brain Arcade” events, Dr. Angela Laird (Director), Dr. Matthew Sutherland (Co-Director), and Jessica Bartley (graduate student) moderated a set of public discussions on neuroimaging, and neurobiology behind optical illusions. Jessica was joined by Julio A. Yanes (Coordinator of Research) during the Museum’s day-long Brain Fair, where they educated children and families about ongoing research using active demonstrations with games and a “brain helmet,” equipped with LED lights representing neural networks. A great time was had by all!
