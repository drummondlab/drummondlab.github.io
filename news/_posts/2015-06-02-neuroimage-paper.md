Good news! A recent paper, authored by Dr. Angela Laird (Director), has been accepted for publication in the journal NeuroImage! Dr. Sutherland (Co-Director), Dr. Riedel (Postdoc), and Dr. Ray (lab alumnus) are co-authors.

The paper, entitled “Neural architecture underlying classification of face perception paradigms,” examines the neural architecture of face perception studies archived in the BrainMap database. Overall, findings from the paper demonstrate that large-scale data mining approaches can inform the evolution of theoretical cognitive models. NeuroImage plans to publish the paper in 2015. Congratulations, everyone!
