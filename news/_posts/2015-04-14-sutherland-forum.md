This week, Dr. Matthew Sutherland (Co-Director) was asked to lead a public forum on neuroimaging, as part of Miami’s Brain Awareness Week, hosted by the Patricia and Phillip Frost Miami Museum of Science. The “Brain and Addiction” event, which Dr. Sutherland moderated, was centered around public discussions on medical applications in neuroimaging, addictions and the brain. Dr. Sutherland was joined by South Miami Hospital Addiction Treatment & Recovery Center’s Medical Director, Dr. John Eustace, and Assistant Vice President, David Vittoria. Conversations included altered reward processing, drugs of abuse, and treatments. Way to go, Dr. Sutherland!
