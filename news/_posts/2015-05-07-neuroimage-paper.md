Good news! Dr. Michael Riedel’s recent paper, entitled “Meta-analytic connectivity and behavioral parcellation of the human cerebellum,” has been accepted for publication in the journal NeuroImage!

In the paper, Dr. Riedel used meta-analytic methods to derive correspondence in cerebellar organization according to task-independent connectivity and behavioral specialization. In addition, this work highlights the heterogeneous function of the cerebellum as a component of both motor and cognitive processes. Congratulations, Dr. Riedel! His paper is set to publish in 2015.
