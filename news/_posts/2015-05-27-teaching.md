excerpt: Lab members teach South Florida's students about brain science.
---

Students from Key Point Academy at First Presbyterian Church in Miami (Brickell, Florida) took a field-trip to Florida International University’s Modesto Maidique Campus. During their visit, the students toured the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum outdoor exhibits. Afterward, Dr. Angela Laird (Director) led the kindergarteners and first-graders through a “brain science” presentation, which highlighted “being a scientist,” brain health, and others. After the presentation, lab members facilitated a “brain hats” activity, designed to help students learn the major lobes of the brain, their general function, and more.
