Good news! Jessica Bartley, a third year Ph.D. student in the Neuroinformatics and Brain Connectivity (NBC) Laboratory, has been awarded first place in a department-wide competition of graduate research! This year’s competition of oral presentations welcomed nine FIU Physics Ph.D. students to present their dissertation research to an audience of faculty and peers. A faculty panel awarded Jessica first prize, which included a cash prize of $500, for her presentation entitled “Physics Learning Facilitates Enhanced Resting-State Brain Connectivity in Problem Solving Network”. Jessica’s work is funded by the National Science Foundation’s REAL DRL-1420627 grant.
